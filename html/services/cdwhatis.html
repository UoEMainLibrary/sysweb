        Desktop?</b><a name="whatis"></a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Common Desktop 
        is how we refer to the Operating System (OS) that runs on all Library 
        Staff PCs. Every PC has to have an OS to function in any way, as it is 
        the OS that controls and communicates with the hardware and deals with 
        the software running on the PC. The current OS is Microsoft Windows 98, 
        which replaced the older Windows 95 during the summer of 2001. All normal 
        staff PCs within the library is configured in the same way with the same 
        OS and this what makes them common.</font></p>

        goes wrong?<a name="wrong"></a></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If something goes 
        wrong with your PC, you should first check the online documentation available 
        and then alert helpdesk. Since all PCs are configured the same, the Systems 
        department can provide support with an increased response speed. If a 
        PC has a software fault of any kind that we can't rectify quickly, we 
        can simply reinstall the OS and associated software via a set of prewritten 
        scripts, which run automatically. In fact, we recently have been able 
        to allow users to re-install their own machines. However, we try not to 
        do this often as a personal call by a member of support staff will usually 
        solve the problem.</font></p>

        own software?<a name="software"></a></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Systems Department 
        will not support software that is installed to the Common Desktop without 
        prior authorisation. If you have specialist software that you feel could 
        be of benefit to your work, you should in the first instance contact helpdesk. 
        The software will then be tested to check that it complies with the Common 
        Desktop configuration. Should this be the case, we will then proceed to 
        create a changefile, which will allow installation of the software at 
        the next Maintenance Level.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will always be 
        able to access the same set of icons no matter what staff PC you choose 
        to log in to. However, we are looking at restricting access to certain 
        icons, which lead to software packages only required by a small number 
        people.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are currently looking 
        into this issue and at the moment, software application access is being 
        monitored by an administration package called Soft Track. Soft Track allows 
        us to restrict the number of people who can access an application at any 
        one time. For example, if we have 5 licenses for Macromedia Flash, when 
        the 6th person tries to access it they will be denied.</font></p>

        Levels?<a name="maintain"></a></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are frequently 
        asked to make updates to the Common Desktop and we do this via Maintenance 
        Levels. The Maintenance Level is a script which allows us to automatically 
        install software and patches to all the staff PCs upon the user logging 
        in to the PC. Each Maintenance Level is numbered so that scripts appear 
        in sequence. We try to make sure that the Maintenance Level is relatively 
        quick so that it causes the least amount of inconvenience for staff members.
