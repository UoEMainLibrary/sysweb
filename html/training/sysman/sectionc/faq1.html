<I>A.  You can only move a PC by yourself if you are moving it to somewhere within a few metres of its original position.  The Systems department will always carry out this task for you if you are moving to another area.  This is because we may need to change the number that your PC 
is identified by on the network.  Also, this will prevent problems with cabling etc.  Contact helpdesk if you require any 
equipment moved.</I>

 calls and not faults.  Most faults are fixed within two days, that is faults to an existing service.  However,
 a development call usually involves project time, money or policy decisions.  You should always receive a call reference 
number within a few hours.</I>
